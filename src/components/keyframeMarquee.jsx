          Oh yeah, good luck with that. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss
          something fun? Please, Don-Botâ€¦ look into your hard drive, and open
          your mercy file! Do a flip! Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like
          professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.

          I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little
          food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you
          sexually? Bite my shiny metal ass. But I've never been to the moon!
